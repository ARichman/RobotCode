RobotCode
=========
Hello, everybody. Now, it seems that we have a long period of opportunity upon us. With all of this time over the break, I am going to be learning many interesting APIs, including FRC APIs. I hope to learn a considerable amount of the vision API, specifically. I am also going to try to modify the current code to find errors and possibly discover why the code failed last meeting. As I am only learning, I will be commenting on what I can for easy reference. These comments, along with commit messages, will also be used for questions (to you, Marc) on what I am unable to understand.

I hope that you all enjoy the break, while it lasts. Just be prepared for the continue. (ha ha, mildly incorrect loop humor)
