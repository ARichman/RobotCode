12/20/13: Created a new branch to the repository to alter the code to work with testbot and learn FRC vision.
Any contributor wishing to join me may do so.
(For Vision API specification, look in C:/WindRiver/docs/extensions)
I began to remove old elements that were useless or not applicable to our current situation.

12/21/13: I checked my e-mail to find questions answered and vehement protests made to a simple function change
(which, through implicit type conversions, I suppose was unnecessary).
Until we actually have another working gyro, I will not change the identifier of "gyro".
I seemed to have missed removing superUltra in the .cpp file, so I did that today.
I created this file to record all changes without worrying about making a ridiculous number of commit messages.
Quesion: Why is it that we use kForward with our relay, but kOff to turn the LED off? Why not use kOff or kReverse?

12/23/13: Started to tackle vision with comments.

12/29/13: Hello, everybody. I am sorry for the sudden pause in action on my branch, but I got a bit distracted by
my new Arduino starter kit. Oh well. I'll be more active by the time we get back. FIRST Choice opened today. Some cheap
items are out of stock, but most major items have barely been touched.
